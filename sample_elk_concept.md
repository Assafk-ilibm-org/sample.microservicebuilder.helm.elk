# About the Microservice Builder ELK Sample

The Sample ELK stack holds and displays logging and tracing data in an **E**lasticsearch, **L**ogstash and **K**ibana (ELK) stack.

The ELK stack provides a central logging facility that can receive access events, message events, trace events, FFDC events, and garbage collection events from one or more Liberty servers that run on Kubernetes.

The sample pulls the key and certificate from the truststore and keystore generated by the _fabric_ that secure the connection between Logstash and Liberty instances. The sample is deployed to Kubernetes through a helm chart.

_Logstash_ receives logging data from different sources, filters it, and then sends it to _Elasticsearch_ for indexing.

With _Kibana_, you can view and query the logging data. You can create searches and combine them into visualizations and dashboards to display relevant logging data. Deployment of this sample also deploys a [Liberty dashboard](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.logstash.collector/blob/master/version-1.0/liberty-kibana4.json?cm_mc_uid=&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1488313377) onto _Kibana_.

__Important__: To use the Sample ELK stack, make sure to deploy the Microservice Builder _fabric_ first.
